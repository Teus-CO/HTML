      <h2>How will Europa Clipper gather it's data?</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Europa Clipper has a powerful suite of nine science instruments that will work in sync while collecting data to accomplish the mission’s science objectives. During each flyby, the full array of instruments will gather measurements and images that will be layered together to paint the full picture of Europa.</p>

      <h3>Cameras</h3>
      <p>Europa Clipper’s visible-light cameras (extending slightly into near-infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths) will map Europa at far better resolution than previous missions. The spacecraft’s two infrared cameras will map the moon’s surface composition, temperature, and roughness. Together, the cameras and other instruments will reveal much about Europa’s chemistry and geologic activity.

      <h3>spectometry</h3>
      <p>Different atoms and molecules emit, absorb, and reflect various wavelengths of light in telltale ways. As such, light carries information about materials it has interacted with. Europa Clipper’s spectrometer and spectrograph will dissect incoming infrared and ultraviolet light to decode that information and reveal the composition of Europa’s surface, and of particles in space near Europa.</p>

      <h3>Plasma and Magnetic Field</h3>
      <p>Jupiter’s magnetic field, the largest in the solar system, traps the charged particle gas – plasma – that fills the space surrounding Europa (and the rest of the Jupiter system). As Europa moves in its orbit, the magnetic field varies. Time-variations of the magnetic field induce Europa to produce its own magnetic field that, in turn, will provide clues to the structure of the moon’s interior.</p>

      <h3>Radar & Gravity</h3>
      <p>Europa’s physical properties affect radio signals, which will help reveal the moon’s interior. A gravity experiment will analyze frequency shifts in the spacecraft’s signals to Earth (the same signals used in communication and navigation) to study Europa’s internal structure. A radar instrument will transmit radio into Europa’s icy shell and analyze the bounced signals to “see” internal features.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Chemical Analysis</h3>
      <p>Radar and cameras “look” at things from afar, while other science instruments such as magnetometers sense the environment immediately around the spacecraft. Still others collect gas and dust in space to identify their chemical makeup. Europa Clipper’s complementary dust spectrometer and neutral gas mass spectrometer perform such collections; they are the mission’s “hands-on” experiments.</p>
