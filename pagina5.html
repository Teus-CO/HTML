    <div class="content">
      <p>NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft launched in October 2024 and will conduct a detailed survey of Jupiter's icy moon Europa to determine whether there are places below the surface that could support life. The spacecraft will arrive at Jupiter in 2030, and once in orbit around Jupiter, it will conduct nearly 50 flybys of Europa, shifting its flight path for each encounter to soar over a different location so that it eventually scans almost the entire moon.</p>

      <h3>Launch</h3>
      <p>Europa Clipper launches from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on Oct. 14, 2024.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Mars flyby</h3>
      <p>Depending on the launch day, Europa Clipper will come to within 300 to 600 miles (500 to 1,000 kilometers) of the surface of Mars. This enables the spacecraft to use the planet’s gravity to help it accelerate towards Jupiter in March 2025.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Earth flyby</h3>
      <p>Europa Clipper comes home (briefly) for its second gravity assist, swinging about 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) from Earth. This flyby, along with the earlier Mars flyby, gives the spacecraft enough energy to reach Jupiter in December 2026.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Jupiter Orbit Insertion</h3>
      <p>Europa Clipper will use its engines as brakes to slow the spacecraft down to match Jupiter's orbit. This process will take about six hours – unusually long for a space probe. However, Europa Clipper’s engines are designed and tested to ensure they are up to the task. Europa Clipper will fly by Jupiter’s moon Ganymede as it does so in April 2030.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Shaping Spacecraft Orbit</h3>
      <p>Europa Clipper will use multiple flybys of Jupiter’s Galilean moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in our solar system, to reduce the spacecraft's orbit to the desired resonance with Europa’s orbit in October 2030.</p>
    </div>
  </main>
  <main>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>First Europa Flyby</h3>
      <p>During the transition to the mission’s first science campaign, Europa Clipper makes its first flyby of its target: Jupiter’s icy moon Europa. Europa Clipper uses this flyby to help shape its orbit around Jupiter. It will gather the first close-up Europa science observations of the mission in spring 2031.</p>
    </div>
  </main>
  <main>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>First Science Campaign Begins</h3>
      <p>Repeated flybys of Europa’s anti-Jovian side begin. The anti-Jovian side of Europa is the one that faces away from Jupiter. Spacecraft instruments gather data on Europa's subsurface ocean, icy shell, surface, and thin atmosphere. Closest-approach altitudes will be approximately as low as 16 miles (25 kilometers) from the surface of Europa in May 2031.</p>
    </div>
  </main>
  <main>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Second Science Campaign Begins</h3>
      <p>Europa Clipper begins its second science campaign, now concentrating flybys over the hemisphere facing toward Jupiter (it’s sub-Jovian side). After the mission’s first science campaign, Europa Clipper’s trajectory transitions so that flybys will continue over the sub-Jovian side of Europa. There the Europa Clipper spacecraft will continue to use its full suite of instruments to gather data about the icy moon in May 2033.</p>
    </div>
  </main>
  <main>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Possible End of Mission: Ganymede Impact</h3>
      <p>The current end of mission plan calls for Europa Clipper to deorbit into Ganymede's surface after its mission is complete in September 2034.</p>
